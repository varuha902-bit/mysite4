= 🤝 Compatibility with WooCommerce plugins =
Advanced AJAX Product Filters has been tested and compatibility is certain with the following WooCommerce plugins that you can add to your site:

&#128312; [**Advanced Product Labels for WooCommerce**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-product-labels-for-woocommerce/)
&#128312; [**Load More Products for WooCommerce**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/load-more-products-for-woocommerce/)

= 🧩 Shortcode =
* In editor `[br_filters attribute=price type=slider title="Price Filter"]`
* In PHP `do_shortcode('[br_filters attribute=price type=slider title="Price Filter"]');`

= ⚙️ Shortcode Options: =
* `attribute`(required) - product attribute, e.g. price or length. Don't forget that WooCommerce adds the pa_ suffix for created attributes.
 So if you create a new attribute `jump`, its name is `pa_jump`
* `type`(required) - checkbox, radio, slider or select
* `operator` - OR or AND
* `title` - whatever you want to see as a title. Can be empty
* `product_cat` - parent category id
* `cat_propagation` - should we propagate this filter to child categories? Set 1 to turn this on
* `height` - max filter box height. When height is met, the scroll will be added
* `scroll_theme` - used if height is set and actual height of the box is more
